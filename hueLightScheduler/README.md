# Light Scheduler

This project is a Go-based microservice for turning Phillips Hue lights on and off on a schedule

## To-Dos

- Configure the timezone within the container

- Make the night start and end times configurable via the config.yml file

- Make the lights that are powered on/off a list rather than a single light name

- Refactor the code

- Explore better optimized options for checking the time and deciding whether to power on/off
